# Books Search Engine

## Description

The Books Search Engine is a web application that allows users to search for books using the Google Books API, save their favorite books, and manage their saved books with a user-friendly interface. Built with the MERN stack, this application uses GraphQL for data fetching and mutation, providing a more efficient way to interact with the database.
